# Random Quote Machine

This is a **Random Quote Machine** project built to meet the specifications of the [freeCodeCamp project](https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/). The goal of this project is to develop a web app that displays a random quote each time the user interacts with the interface. The app has been built using modern frontend technologies including **Vite**, **React**, **Redux**, and **TypeScript** to showcase my skills and experience.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can see the app in action [here](https://main--heartfelt-tartufo-9edc51.netlify.app/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Features

- **Random Quote Generation**: Fetches a new quote each time you press the button.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes an API to get a collection of quotes.
- **React & Redux**: State management and UI rendering handled with React and Redux.
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking and clean code organization.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design to provide a smooth experience across devices.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **React 18**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **CSS/Bootstrap/SASS**: For styling the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mshaikhly/fCC-random-quote-machine.git

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev

4. **Open the app in your browser:**

   Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

## ‚úÖ User Stories

This project fulfills the following user stories:

- **User Story #1**: I can see a random quote.
- **User Story #2**: I can press a button to get a new quote.
- **User Story #3**: The quote container should have a corresponding background color that changes with the quote.

## üß™ Testing

React 18 has known incompatibilities with some of the tests for this project (see the known issue). However, all tests were run and passed successfully.


## üíª How It Works

- **App Structure**: The app uses a modular approach, with components split into separate files for better organization.
- **Redux for State Management**: Redux is used to manage the state of the quote data and ensures the app is predictable and easy to debug.
- **Vite for Development**: Vite provides fast build times and modern features for an efficient development experience.

## üìö Additional Notes

## üé® Personal Touch

I added my own personal styling and additional features, making the app unique while still meeting the core requirements of the project. I added a dark/light mode button.
